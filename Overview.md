### Overview

**Aim**  
Teach participants the tools needed to publish their code in a journal such as The Journal of Open Source Software

**Context**  
A growing number of researchers use and write code for their research. This code should be published to enable reproducibile and extensible research, but this is not currently widespread practice. There are different ways code can be made available - eg: a code snippet on a blog, emailed on request, or an interactive notebook available as supplementary information. For more substantial pieces of code there is also a growing number of journals which are focused on the review and publishing of scientific software. The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is one such journal, and requires that the code is tested, documented and undergoes peer review - ie, it encourages "best practice" in scientific software engineering.

**Audience**  
Researchers who currently code.

**Timing**  
Two days, 10-5pm with 2 hours for breaks = 10 hours of workshop time.

**Location**  
London, TBC.

**Participant pre-requisites**  
version control (git), a programming language, basic bash, code available on github or similar.

**Teaching materials**  
The ["Get your code publication ready"](https://lucydot.github.io/publication-ready) workshop materials are currently being developed. These will incorporate materials from the [Code Refinery](https://coderefinery.org).

**Project Partners**  
Code Refinery, RSLondon and the Software Sustainability Institute

### Course Contents

*Note: The lesson is structured around the submission criteria for The Journal of Open Source Software, however this aligns well with the submission criteria for other journals such as [The Journal of Open Research Software (https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)*

*Note: Examples will be in Python, as this is a widely used and readable language. Language-specific groups will form for the activities OR there will be examples for Python and R.*

The workshop will include:

- Motivation: Why publish your code?
  - this could incorporate elements from the "social coding and open research" coderefinery lesson
- Which journals can I publish in? What are the submission criteria? Focus on JOSS.
  - case studies: students work in pairs to look at the software projects and discuss how they meet the JOSS criteria (these could be accepted packages or packages awaiting review)
  - a useful resource here would be a table of journals and what the submission criteria is for each
- introduction to JOSS: submission workflow, incl. the transparent peer review process
- Structuring your project (incl. semantic versioning)
  - this could incorporate elements from the "reproducible research" coderefinery lesson
- Testing and continuous integration 
  - Using Code Refinery workshop resources?
- Documentation
  - Using Code Refinery workshop resources?
- Licensing
  - Using resources from the "social coding and open research" code refinery lesson?

The workshop *could* include:

- how to do a code review, nicely! (useful if we go with a peer pre-submission code review - see section below )
  - we could ask alex hill from Imperial to deliver this: https://www.alexandra-hill.com/2018/06/25/the-art-of-giving-and-receiving-code-reviews/
  - after this we could do a code review session: i) assign pairs for code review ii) 15 minutes to look at code (on github) iii) 10 minutes for feedback to each other - can you identify the next steps needed towards code publication?
- code linting
- a talk from a JOSS editor for the introduction to JOSS? With wine and soft drinks?
- modular code development

### Example workshop timings

- Day one: 
  - 10-10.10: welcome / introductions / housekeeping 
  - 10.10-10.30: why publish your code?
  - 10.30-11: which journals can I publish in and what are the submission criteria?
  - 11-11.30: case study activity
  - 11.30-11.50: break
  - 11.50-12.30: automated testing
  - 12.30-13.30: lunch
  - 13.30-14.45: automated testing 
  - 14.45-15.05: break
  - 15.05-15.55: automiated testing 
  - 15.55-16.15: break
  - 16.15-17.00: introduction to JOSS
 
- Day two:
  - 10-10.10: welcome to day two / recap on yesterday
  - 10.10-10.30: structuring your project 
  - 10.30-11.00: licensing
  - 11.00-11.20: break
  - 11.20-12.30: documentation
  - 12.30-13.30: lunch
  - 13.30-14.30: documentation
  - 14.30-14.50: break
  - 14.50-15.30: how to do a code review
  - 15.30-16.10: mini code review to identify next steps
  
  *Having 50 minutes spare is probably a wise thing - flexibility to adapt / extend as needed*

### Pre-course questionnaire

- Assess the level at which entering 
- Confirm that they have basic git skills
- Ask for a link to code available online (could be a script on github) - *or is this too high an entrance barrier?*
- Assess interest in participating in peer pre-submission code review after the workshop

### Peer pre-submission code review

- To provide support/confidence prior to JOSS (or equivalent) submission
- Short 30 minute review (possibly online), going through the journal criteria
- Provide tool or checklist to aid with the review
