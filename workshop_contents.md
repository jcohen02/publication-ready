- introduction to JOSS: submission workflow, incl. the transparent peer review process
- Structuring your project (incl. semantic versioning)
  - this could incorporate elements from the "reproducible research" coderefinery lesson
- Testing and continuous integration 
  - Using Code Refinery workshop resources?
- Documentation
  - Using Code Refinery workshop resources?
- Licensing
  - Using resources from the "social coding and open research" code refinery lesson?

The workshop *could* include:

- how to do a code review, nicely! (useful if we go with a peer pre-submission code review - see section below )
  - we could ask alex hill from Imperial to deliver this: https://www.alexandra-hill.com/2018/06/25/the-art-of-giving-and-receiving-code-reviews/
  - after this we could do a code review session: i) assign pairs for code review ii) 15 minutes to look at code (on github) iii) 10 minutes for feedback to each other - can you identify the next steps needed towards code publication?
- code linting
- a talk from a JOSS editor for the introduction to JOSS? With wine and soft drinks?
- modular code development
