## JOSS-ready code / get your code publication ready

I think 2-day course. London: 10-5, 2 hours break - 5 hours teaching.

Starting point: What does JOSS look for? Use this to structure. Then split each thing they look for as a pre-requisite or to cover.

Pre-requisites: version control (git), a programming language, basic bash 

Case studies of accepted code  - in groups. Looking at it against the JOSS criteria. 

Support for submission: informal mentoring - instructors, or peer? Ask for interest in advance?

Through RSLondon?

Lessons: why publish your code?, what are the requirements?, JOSS sumission workflow incl. peer review, case study, package structure (what should it contain?), testing, continuous integration, documentation, packaging and distribution (version numbers), licensing, 

Notes: 
	- examples will be in Python
	- more material than can handle
	- support for submission: mentoring?
	- combine with reprohack?
	- need to not forget at each stage to emphasise why this is important (reproducibility for travis etc)


### TODO

- decide on name: JOSS-ready / publication-ready?
