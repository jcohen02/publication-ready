## Context

A growing number of researchers use and write code for their research.
This code should be published to allow for reproducibility of results; however, despite a growing number of journals requiring that the code needed to reproduce results is made available, this is not currently widespread practice.
There are different ways code can be made available - eg: a code snippet on a blog, emailed on request, an interactive notebook available as supplementary information.
For more substantial pieces of code there is also a [growing number of journals](https://www.codeisscience.com/journal_table) which are focused on the review and publishing of scientific software.
[The Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org) (JOSS) is one such journal, and requires that the code is tested, documented and undergoes peer review - as such, they promote best practice in development of scientific software. 

> ## The Journal of Open Source Software
>
> The lesson is structured around the submission criteria for [The Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org), however this
> aligns well with the submission criteria for other journals such as [The Journal of Open Research Software
> (https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)

## Course Objective

To enable researchers in the materials science community (short term) and beyond (longer term) to publish their code with an open source software journal.

> ## Where these lessons are from
>
> Lesson material inspired by the work of [Code Refinery](https://coderefinery.org/)
>
> Note that the testing chapter was adapted from the workshop
> *[Python Testing and Continuous Integration](https://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/)*
> which was adapted from the Testing chapter in
> *[Effective Computation In Physics](http://physics.codes)*
> by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Huff.
