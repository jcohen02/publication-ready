### TODO: workshop content

- [ ] Settle on name: "get your code publication ready" is clunky!
- [ ] Decide whether to go down the examples in R and Python route --> if so, then we will need to find someone who is an R expert
- [ ] Draw up a list of the submission requirements for popular open source software journals

### TODO: workshop practicalities

e.g.

- [ ] Set date
- [ ] Set location
- [ ] Find instructors

- [ ] Advertise course
- [ ] Send out pre-course questionnaire
