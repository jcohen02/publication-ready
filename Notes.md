### Ideas: 

- Invite a JOSS topic editor along?
- Coordinate with a reprohack either before or after?
- Find people who would be willing to mentor a software project? Or do pre-submission code reviews?

### Notes:

- Richard Darst at Aalto suggested as someone who may give nice feedback
- Adam Jackson has stated interest 
- At each stage of workshop need to emphasise why this tool is important (reproducibility for travis etc)
